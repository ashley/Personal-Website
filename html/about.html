				<div id="about-text">I'm currently an undergraduate at Simmons College with a focus in Computer Science. However, my skills and experiences exceed greater than my schooling. I am devoted to utilizing technology and design to better our world. Challenges like improving STEM education, obtaining social change, and finding environment sustainability are just three of the many real-world problems I help to solve. When I'm not hacking, designing mockups, or taking photographs, I volunteer mentor young girls in science. </div>
